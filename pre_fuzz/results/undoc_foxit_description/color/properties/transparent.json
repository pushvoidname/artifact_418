    "Object": "color",
    "API_Name": "transparent",
    "API_Type": "property",
    "API_Description": "Represents a transparent color value, typically used to indicate no color or full transparency.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The name 'transparent' suggests that this property is used to represent a color with full transparency, which is common in color objects to denote the absence of color.",
    "Returns": "An array representing the transparent color value.",
    "Returns_Reason": "Since the `color` object is used to define color arrays, it is reasonable to assume that the `transparent` property returns an array that represents a transparent color.",
    "Parameters": {
        "unknown": {
            "description": "A numeric parameter that might influence the transparency level or is a placeholder for future use.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter is labeled as 'unknown', indicating its purpose is not clearly defined. It might be used to adjust transparency or reserved for future functionality.",
            "type": "number",
            "type_reason": "The parameter is explicitly stated to be a number, which suggests it could be used for calculations or adjustments related to transparency."
