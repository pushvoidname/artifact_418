    "Object": "StreamDigest",
    "API_Name": "SHA1",
    "API_Type": "property",
    "API_Description": "Represents the SHA1 hash value of the stream.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The name 'SHA1' suggests it is related to the SHA1 hashing algorithm, which is used to produce a hash value. As a property, it likely represents the hash value of the stream.",
    "Returns": "The SHA1 hash value of the stream.",
    "Returns_Reason": "Since it is a property named 'SHA1', it is reasonable to assume it returns the SHA1 hash value of the stream it is associated with.",
    "Parameters": {
        "type": {
            "description": "The data type of the SHA1 property.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter 'type' is likely used to specify or describe the data type of the SHA1 property.",
            "type": "unknown",
            "type_reason": "The type is specified as unknown, indicating that the exact data type is not provided in the available information."
