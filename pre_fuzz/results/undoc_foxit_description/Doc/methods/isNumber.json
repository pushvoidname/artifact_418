    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Determines if the given string can be interpreted as a number.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name 'isNumber' suggests it checks whether the input string represents a valid number.",
    "Returns": "A boolean indicating whether the input string is a valid number.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method likely returns a boolean value to indicate the result of the check, as it is common for 'is' prefixed methods to return boolean values.",

            "description": "The string to be evaluated to determine if it represents a number.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter is named 'unknown', but based on the method's purpose, it is likely a string that needs to be checked for numeric representation.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "The parameter is expected to be a string since the method checks if it can be interpreted as a number."
