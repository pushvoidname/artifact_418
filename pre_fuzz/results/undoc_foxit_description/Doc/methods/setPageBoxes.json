    "API_Name": "setPageBoxes",
    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Sets the page boundaries (media, crop, bleed, trim, and art boxes) for the specified pages in the document.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name 'setPageBoxes' suggests it is used to define or modify the page boundaries, which are commonly referred to as boxes in PDF terminology.",
    "Returns": "void",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method is likely used to modify the document's state without returning a value, as it sets properties rather than retrieving or creating an object.",
    "Parameters": {
        "nStart": {
            "description": "The 0-based index of the first page to set the boxes for.",
            "description_reason": "Page operations typically require specifying a starting page index, and 'nStart' is a common parameter name for such purposes.",
            "type": "number",
            "type_reason": "Page indices are usually represented as numbers."
        },
        "nEnd": {
            "description": "The 0-based index of the last page to set the boxes for.",
            "description_reason": "To define a range of pages, an ending index is needed, and 'nEnd' is a logical parameter name.",
            "type": "number",
            "type_reason": "Page indices are usually represented as numbers."
        },
        "cBox": {
            "description": "The type of box to set. Valid values are: 'Media', 'Crop', 'Bleed', 'Trim', 'Art'.",
            "description_reason": "The method likely allows setting different types of page boxes, and specifying which box type is necessary.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "Box types are typically represented as strings."
        },

            "description": "An array of four numbers specifying the coordinates of the box in the format [ulx, uly, lrx, lry].",
            "description_reason": "Page boxes are defined by their bounding rectangle, which requires four coordinates.",
            "type": "array",
