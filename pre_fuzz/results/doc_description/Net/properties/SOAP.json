See the referenced link for full documentation.

Net.SOAP methods | connect | Converts the URL of a WSDL document to a JavaScript object with callable methods corresponding to the web service. request | Initiates a remote procedure call (RPC) or sends an XML message to a SOAP HTTP endpoint. The method either waits for the endpoint to reply (synchronous processing) or calls a method on the notification object (asynchronous processing). response | Initiates a remote procedure call (RPC) or sends an XML message to a SOAP HTTP endpoint without waiting for a reply.",
