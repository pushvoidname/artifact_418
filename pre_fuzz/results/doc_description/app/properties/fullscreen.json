The `fs` method returns a `FullScreen` object that can be used to access the fullscreen properties. Controls whether the viewer is in full screen mode or regular viewing mode. !! Note A PDF document being viewed from within a web browser cannot be put into full screen mode. Full screen mode can be initiated from within the browser, but applies only to a document open in the Acrobat viewer application, if any, not to the browser itself.",
