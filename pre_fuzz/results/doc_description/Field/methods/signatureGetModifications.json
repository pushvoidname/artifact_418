  "Returns": "An object containing modification information. The object has the following properties:\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n-----------------------------\nformFieldsCreated | Array of Field objects | Array of form fields created after signing.\nformFieldsDeleted | Array of Generic objects | Array of form fields deleted after signing. Each generic object in the array is a string of the form name: type.\nformFieldsFilledIn | Array of Field objects | Array of form fields filled in after signing.\nformFieldsModified | Array of Field objects | Array of form fields modified after signing. In this context, form field fill-in does not constitute modification.\nannotsCreated | Array of Annotation  objects | Array of annotations created after signing. If the annotation is transient (for example, a dynamically created pop-up), the corresponding element of the array is a string of the form author: name: type.\nannotsDeleted | Array of Generic objects | Array of annotations deleted after signing. Each generic object in the array is of the form author: name: type.\nannotsModified | Array of Annotation  objects | Array of annotations modified after signing. If the annotation is transient (for example, a dynamically created pop-up), the corresponding element of the array is a string of the form author: name: type.\nnumPagesCreated | Integer | Number of pages added after signing.\nnumPagesDeleted | Integer | Number of pages deleted after signing.\nnumPagesModified | Integer | Number of pages whose content has been modified after signing (add/delete/modify of annotations/form fields are not considered as page modification for this purpose).\nspawnedPagesCreated | Array of Strings | List of pages spawned after signing. For each spawned page, the name of the source template is provided.\nspawnedPagesDeleted | Array of Strings | List of spawned pages deleted after signing. For each spawned page, the name of the source template is provided.\nspawnedPagesModified | Array of Strings | List of spawned pages modified after signing. For each spawned page, the name of the source template is provided.",
