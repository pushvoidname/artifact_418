Beginning with version 8.0, a PDF file can be imported as artwork into LiveCycle Designer. The possibly rich graphical content of the PDF is used as a background on which form fields can be placed using LiveCycle Designer. The `XFAForeground` property reports back whether the PDF was created in this way, a value of `true` means the PDF was imported into LiveCycle Designer as artwork, then saved by LiveCycle Designer.",
