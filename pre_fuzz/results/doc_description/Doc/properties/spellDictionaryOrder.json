For example, the form designer of a medical form may want to specify a medical dictionary to be searched first before searching the user\u2019s preferred order. The Spelling plug-in first searches for words in this array, then searches the dictionaries the user has selected on the Spelling Preference panel. The user\u2019s preferred order is available from `spell.dictionaryOrder` . An array of the currently installed dictionaries can be obtained using `spell.dictionaryNames` . !! Note When setting this property, an exception is thrown if any of the elements in the array is not a valid dictionary name.",
