  "API_Description": "Imports a row of data from a text file. Each row must be . The entries in the first row of the text file are the column names of the tab delimited data. These names are also field names for text fields present in the PDF file. The data row numbers are 0-based; that is, the first row of data is row zero (this does not include the column name row). When a row of data is imported, each column datum becomes the field value of the field that corresponds to the column to which the data belongs.",
