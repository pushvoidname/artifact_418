Launching may involve opening an external application if the file is not a PDF file. The values of nLaunch are:  -  If the value is 0, the file will not be launched after it is saved.  -  If the value is 1, the file will be saved and then launched. Launching will prompt the user with a security alert warning if the file is not a PDF file. The user will be prompted for a save path.  -  If the value is 2, the file will be saved and then launched. Launching will prompt the user with a security alert warning if the file is not a PDF file. A temporary path is used, and the user will not be prompted for a save path.
