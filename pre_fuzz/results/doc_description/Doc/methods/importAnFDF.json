  "Parameters": {
    "cPath": {
      "description": "(optional) The device-independent path to the FDF file. It should look like the value of the F entry in an FDF file exported with the submitForm method or with the Forms > Manage Form Data > Export Data From Form menu item.

  "Returns": "",
  "Examples": [
    "The following code, which is an action of a Page Open event, checks whether a certain function, `ProcResponse` , is already defined, if not, it installs a document-level JavaScript, which resides in an FDF file.\n\n```\nif(typeof ProcResponse == \"undefined\") this.importAnFDF(\"myDLJS.fdf\");\n```\n\nHere, the path is a relative one. This technique may be useful for automatically installing document-level scripts for PDF files distilled from a PostScript file."
