  "Examples": [
    "This function is useful to populate a document with a series of named icons for later retrieval. For example, an author may want a picture of a list box state to appear next to the list box when the user selects the state in a list box. Without this function, it could be done by using a number of fields that could be hidden and shown. However, this is difficult to author. Instead, the appropriate script might be something like this:\n\n```\nvar f = this.getField(\"StateListBox\");\nvar b = this.getField(\"StateButton\");\nb.buttonSetIcon(this.getIcon(f.value));\n```\n\nThis uses a single field to perform the same effect.\n\nA simple user interface can be constructed to add named icons to a document. Assume the existence of two fields: a field called `IconName` that will contain the icon name and a field called `IconAdd` that will add the icon to the document. The mouse-up script for `IconAdd` would be:\n\n```\nvar t = this.getField(\"IconName\");\nthis.importIcon(t.value);\n```\n\nThe same kind of script can be applied in a batch setting to populate a document with every selected icon file in a folder."
