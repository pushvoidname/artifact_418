  "API_Description": "Exports form fields as an FDF file to the local hard drive.",
  "Version": "4.0",
  "Save-Prefs": "No",
  "Security": "Yes",
  "Product": "F",
  "Parameters": {
    "bAllFields": {
      "description": "(optional) If true, all fields are exported, including those that have no value. If false (the default), excludes those fields that currently have no value."
    },
    "bNoPassword": {
      "description": "(optional) If true (the default), do not include text fields that have the password flag set in the exported FDF file."
    },
    "aFields": {
      "description": "(optional) The array of field names to submit or a string containing a single field name:  -  If specified, only these fields are exported, except those excluded by bNoPassword.  -  If aFields is an empty array, no fields are exported. The FDF file might still contain data, depending on the bAnnotations parameter. -  If this parameter is omitted or is null, all fields in the form are exported, except those excluded by bNoPassword.   Specify non-terminal field names to export an entire subtree of fields (see the example below)."
    },
    "bFlags": {
      "description": "(optional) If true, field flags are included in the exported FDF file. The default is false."
    },
    "cPath": {
      "description": "(optional) A string specifying the device-independent path for the file. The path may be relative to the location of the current document. If the parameter is omitted, a dialog box is shown to let the user select the file.  -  The parameter cPath must have a safe path (see Safe path) and have a .fdf extension. This method will throw a NotAllowedError (see Error object) exception if these security conditions are not met, and the method will fail."
    },
    "bAnnotations": {
      "description": "(optional, Acrobat 6.0) If true, annotations are included in the exported FDF file. The default is false."
    }

  "Returns": "",
  "Examples": [
    "Export the entire form (including empty fields) with flags.\n\n```\nthis.exportAsFDF(true, true, null, true);\n```",
    "Export the subtree with no flags.\n\n```\nthis.exportAsFDF(false, true, \"name\");\n```\n\nThis example shows a shortcut to exporting a whole subtree. By passing \u201cname\u201d as part of the `aFields` parameter, fields such as \u201cname.title\u201d, \u201cname.first\u201d, \u201cname.middle\u201d, and \u201cname.last\u201d are exported."
