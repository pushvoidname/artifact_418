The SOAP 1.1 protocol (see http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/ ) is used to marshall JavaScript parameters to a remote procedure call (either synchronously or asynchronously) and to unmarshall the result as a JavaScript object. The SOAP object also has the ability to communicate with web services, described by the Web Services Description Language (WSDL\u2014see http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl ). !!
