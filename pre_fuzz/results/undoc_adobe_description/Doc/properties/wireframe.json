    "API_Description": "A boolean property that indicates whether the document is displayed in wireframe mode.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The property is of type boolean, which suggests it is a toggle or flag.

            "description": "A boolean value to set or get the wireframe mode state.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter is of type boolean, which is typically used to represent a true/false state or toggle, aligning with the concept of enabling or disabling a mode.",
