    "API_Type": "property",
    "API_Description": "Represents the current temperature reading from the thermometer.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The 'value' property typically represents the current state or measurement of an object, and since this is a thermometer, it is reasonable to assume it represents the current temperature reading.",
    "Returns": "The current temperature reading as a number.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The parameter type is specified as 'number', which suggests that the property returns a numerical value, likely representing the temperature.",

            "description": "The data type of the temperature reading.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter 'type' is specified as 'number', indicating it describes the data type of the value returned by the property.",
            "type": "number",
            "type_reason": "The parameter is explicitly stated to be of type 'number', which aligns with the typical representation of temperature readings."
