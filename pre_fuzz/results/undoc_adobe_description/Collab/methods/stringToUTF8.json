    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Converts a given UCS-2 encoded string to a UTF-8 encoded string.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name 'stringToUTF8' suggests that it performs a conversion from a string to UTF-8 encoding. Given the parameter 'ucsStr', it is likely that the input is a UCS-2 encoded string, which is a common encoding format that needs conversion to UTF-8 for compatibility with various systems.",
    "Returns": "A UTF-8 encoded string.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method is expected to return the result of the conversion, which would be the input string encoded in UTF-8 format.",
    "Parameters": {
        "ucsStr": {
            "description": "The UCS-2 encoded string that needs to be converted to UTF-8.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'ucsStr' implies that it is a string encoded in UCS-2 format, which is a precursor to UTF-16 and often used in systems that require conversion to UTF-8.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "The parameter is a string because it represents text data that needs to be converted from one encoding to another."
