    "Object": "Collab",
    "API_Name": "hashString",
    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Generates a hash value for a given string input.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name 'hashString' suggests that it takes a string and returns a hashed version of it, which is a common operation in programming for purposes such as data integrity, security, or indexing.",
    "Returns": "A hashed representation of the input string.",
    "Returns_Reason": "Hash functions typically return a fixed-size string or number that represents the input data, which is consistent with the expected behavior of a method named 'hashString'.",
    "Parameters": {
        "cStr": {
            "description": "The string to be hashed.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'cStr' implies it is a string, and since the method is 'hashString', it is logical that this parameter is the input string to be hashed.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "The parameter is named 'cStr', which is a common naming convention for strings, and the method's purpose is to hash a string, confirming the type."
