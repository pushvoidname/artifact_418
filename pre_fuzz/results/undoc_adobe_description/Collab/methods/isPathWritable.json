    "API_Name": "isPathWritable",
    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Checks if a specified path is writable in the given file system context.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name 'isPathWritable' suggests that it determines whether a path can be written to, and the parameters likely specify the path and the file system context.",
    "Returns": "A boolean indicating whether the path is writable.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method likely returns a boolean value to indicate the writability status of the path, as suggested by the method name 'isPathWritable'.",
    "Parameters": {
        "cPath": {
            "description": "The path to check for writability.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'cPath' suggests it represents the path whose writability is being checked.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "Paths are typically represented as strings in programming contexts."
        },

            "description": "The file system context in which to check the path's writability.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'cFS' suggests it specifies the file system context, which may affect the writability of the path.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "File system contexts are often represented as strings, such as identifiers or names."
