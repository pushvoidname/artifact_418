    "API_Type": "Method",
    "API_Description": "Converts a DI (Document Interchange) path to a platform-specific file path.",
    "API_Description_Reason": "The method name suggests it is responsible for converting a DI path, which is likely a standardized path format used within the application, to a path format that is specific to the operating system or platform.",
    "Returns": "A string representing the platform-specific file path.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method is expected to return a path, and since paths are typically represented as strings, it is reasonable to assume the return type is a string.",
    "Parameters": {
        "cDIPath": {
            "description": "The DI path that needs to be converted to a platform-specific path.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'cDIPath' indicates it is a DI path, which is the input for the conversion process.",
            "type": "string",
            "type_reason": "Paths are generally represented as strings, and the 'c' prefix suggests it is a string parameter."

            "description": "A boolean indicating whether to resolve any mounted paths during the conversion.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'bResolveMounts' suggests it controls whether the method should resolve mounted paths, which is a common consideration when converting paths.",
