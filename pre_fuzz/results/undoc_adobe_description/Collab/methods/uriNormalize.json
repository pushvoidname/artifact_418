    "Returns": "A normalized URI string.",
    "Returns_Reason": "The method likely returns the modified or verified URI after normalization, as the purpose of normalization is to produce a standardized output.",

            "description": "The URI string to be normalized.",
            "description_reason": "The parameter name 'cURI' indicates it is a URI, and the context of normalization implies this is the input to be processed.",
